Abstract

The rapid increase in online and real-life choices that we are presented every day is leading to indecisiveness and this has led to requiring games to improve decision making in individuals. The rapid development of online shopping, gambling and entertainment has made a constant flow of choices available to individuals. This research demonstrates a study, that by playing games that mimic the real-world using decision improvement techniques can change the thinking of individuals to make better choices by educating them how to carefully and rapidly analyse choices. The work produced in this project delivers a solution to reduce indecisiveness.
